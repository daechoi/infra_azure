Created terraform for creating vm in azure.  Learned about the structure and how to create the resource_group in azure.  Including depenedencies.

I got carried away...and started dappling with DNS records.  I think I will tackle that after I get more firm foundation on the terraform, including
using python script to create the HCL.
